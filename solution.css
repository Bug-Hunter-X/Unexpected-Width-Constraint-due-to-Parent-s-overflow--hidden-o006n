To fix this, avoid using `overflow: hidden` on the parent element if it's not strictly needed. Alternatively, consider using a different approach, such as setting the width of the parent element to a specific value or using a flexible box layout to manage the width of its children.  The following CSS shows one possible solution:

```css
.parent {
  width: 100%; /* Or a specific width */
}

.container {
  width: 100%;
}
```

Another approach involves using flexbox for the parent:

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
}

.container {
  width: 100%;
}
```
