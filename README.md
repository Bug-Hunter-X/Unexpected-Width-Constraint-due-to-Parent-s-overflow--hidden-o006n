# Unexpected Width Constraint in CSS

This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug where a child element's width is unexpectedly constrained by a parent element's `overflow: hidden` property.  The issue arises when attempting to set the width of a child element to 100%, but the parent's `overflow: hidden` prevents the child from expanding to its full width. 

The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS, while `solution.css` illustrates a solution.
